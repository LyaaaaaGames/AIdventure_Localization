# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to my project! It's very kind. 
However, be sure to read the code of conduit before to contribute.

## How to file a bug report?
Go in **issues**, then click on **new issue** and select **bug report**

## The translation file

All the strings to translate are stored in a `.pot` file. AIdventure use the [GetText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) system.

Then, each language has its own `.po` file.

**You can find the language codes [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/locales.html)**

## How to modify / add new languages

First, you will require a software to edit or create your own translation.

Multiple softwares exists but I will suggest PoEdit because it's free and open source.

1. Download [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)
2. Download the [project](https://github.com/LyaaaaaGames/AIdventure_Localization/archive/refs/heads/Develop.zip).
2. If there is no existing file for your language, open the `aidventure.pot` with **Poedit**
  1. If a file already exist, open the corresponding file `e.g: fr.po` for French.
3. Poedit will suggest you to create a new translation file, do it.
4. You can now translate AIdventure :).

## How to propose your modifications?
1. Fork my project
2. Commit to your repository
3. Open a pull request on the `develop` branch on my repository
